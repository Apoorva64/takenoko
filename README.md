## The game
The theme of the game is to take care of a panda, a gift from the emperor of China to the emperor of Japan,
while taking care of the imperial bamboo grove, maintained by a gardener.

Players cultivate plots of land, irrigate them,
and grow one of three varieties of bamboo (green, yellow or pink)
through this gardener.
